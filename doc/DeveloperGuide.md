## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK 8** or later
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in

## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a new person | compile a list of contacts
`* * *` | user | delete a person | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | find a person by name | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list
`* *` | user | hide [private contact details](#private-contact-detail) by default | minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident
`*`| user | clear my whole addressbook | generate a file from scratch
`*`| user | tag persons | easily categorise people
`*` | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name | locate a person easily


## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Delete person

**MSS**

1. User requests to list persons
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook deletes the person <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

#### Use case: Rename tag

**MSS**
1. User requests to list tags
2. AddressBook shows a list of used tags
3. User selects a specific tag index on the list
4. AddressBook brings up a list of options: Delete tag, Change tag or cancel operation
5. User selects "Change tag"
6. AddressBook prompts user for new name of tag
7. User enters new tag name
8. AddressBook asks for confirmation
9. User confirms
10. Addressbook changes the tag
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list has no tags

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message
  Use case resumes at step 2.

7a. User enters a tag that is already used

> 7a1. AddressBook shows an error messages
  Use case resumes at step 6

9a. User declines

> Use case ends


## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any [mainstream OS](#mainstream-os) as long as it has Java 8 or higher installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons.
3. Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
4. Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
